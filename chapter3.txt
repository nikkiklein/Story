These days the sound of the wind rushing, the water crashing, and people talking in the distance makes just breathing feel heavy. It’s that constant feeling of getting on a rollercoaster, and having your stomach twist into that familiar feeling where your brain screams, “this was a bad idea” –except, there’s no reward when you force yourself through it. Like a bad night terror that you’re forced to repeat… I haven’t woken up in a long time.
